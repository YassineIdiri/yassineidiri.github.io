I present a fully-fledged e-commerce website developed using the Laravel framework. It incorporates essential features, including a secure authentication system, payment processing via Stripe, real-time messaging through WebSockets Pusher, and dynamic pages powered by technologies like Livewire and Fetch JS. This project showcases my expertise in advanced web development and crafting an optimal user experience
